A basic game app made using Android Studio

##Game Details
Play as an arbitrary humanoid character traversing across the screen collecting hams.
Each step your character takes reduces the time bar slightly. Getting the boots increases the time bar a bit.
The game finishes when the time bar falls below 0.

##There's only the source code!
So apparently I have to actually *download* Git onto the machine I'm using to access Android Studio's Git functionality.
Why don't I just download Git then? Due to "certain circumstances", I will only upload core source files.
I'm fairly sure that just raises more questions anyway, but maybe in due time things will change.
