# Baconspace!
A basic game app made using Android Studio

## Game Details
Play as an arbitrary humanoid character traversing across the screen collecting hams.
Each step your character takes reduces the time bar slightly. Getting the boots increases the time bar a bit.
The game finishes when the time bar falls below 0.

## There's only the source code!
So apparently I have to actually *download* Git onto the machine I'm using to access Android Studio's Git functionality.
Why don't I just download Git then? Due to "certain circumstances", I will only upload core source files.
I'm fairly sure that just raises more questions anyway, but maybe in due time things will change.

## Wouldn't starting the project using Git initially solve some of the existing problems?
In a sense, yes. But because this is a free account, all repositories must be Public. 
As a result, keeping projects under wraps can be a bit of a pickle, hence the offline work.
While I do admit that, in good software ettiquette, source control is useful at all stages of development, I wasn't particularly sure if I could *commit* (see what I did there?) this as a project that I would be sure to finish. I mean, I have several half-finished projects, some more regrettable than others, and I don't want to upload code for something that will never be completed **ever**.
